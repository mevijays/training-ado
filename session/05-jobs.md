# Azure DevOps Pipeline Jobs

## Overview
Jobs are the fundamental execution units in Azure DevOps Pipelines. They represent a collection of steps that run sequentially on the same agent. Understanding jobs is crucial for organizing your pipeline work, managing dependencies, and optimizing build performance through parallelization.

## Explanation
A job is a series of steps that are executed in order on a single agent. Jobs are the atomic unit of work in Azure DevOps Pipelines - all steps within a job run on the same agent and share the same workspace. Jobs can run in parallel or in sequence, depending on your pipeline configuration.

### Key Concepts:
- **Job Execution**: Steps within a job run sequentially
- **Agent Assignment**: Each job runs on a single agent
- **Workspace Sharing**: All steps in a job share the same file system
- **Parallelization**: Multiple jobs can run simultaneously on different agents
- **Dependencies**: Jobs can depend on other jobs completing successfully
- **Conditions**: Jobs can have conditions that determine if they should run

## Types of Jobs

### 1. Agent Jobs
- Run on an agent (Microsoft-hosted or self-hosted)
- Execute steps sequentially
- Most common type of job

### 2. Server Jobs
- Run on the Azure DevOps server
- Limited to specific tasks (delays, manual interventions)
- Don't require an agent

### 3. Deployment Jobs
- Special type of agent job for deployments
- Include deployment strategies (runOnce, rolling, canary)
- Track deployment history

### 4. Container Jobs
- Run inside a Docker container
- Provide isolated execution environment
- Consistent across different agents

## Analogy
Think of jobs like different teams working on a construction project:

**Single Job (One Team)**:
- Like having one construction crew
- They work on tasks in order: foundation ‚Üí framing ‚Üí roofing ‚Üí finishing
- All work happens in sequence
- The crew shares tools and workspace
- If one task fails, the whole project stops

**Multiple Jobs (Multiple Teams)**:
- Like having specialized teams: electricians, plumbers, painters
- Teams can work in parallel where possible
- Each team has their own tools and workspace
- Teams can depend on each other (electricians wait for framers)
- If one team fails, others might continue or stop based on dependencies

**Job Dependencies**:
- Like construction phases: foundation must complete before framing starts
- Some work can happen in parallel (electrical and plumbing rough-in)
- Final inspection waits for all teams to finish

## Job Configuration Options

### Basic Job Properties:
- **displayName**: Human-readable name for the job
- **dependsOn**: Specify job dependencies
- **condition**: Control when a job runs
- **pool**: Specify which agent pool to use
- **variables**: Job-specific variables
- **timeoutInMinutes**: Maximum execution time
- **cancelTimeoutInMinutes**: Time to wait for graceful cancellation

## Job Dependencies and Conditions

### Basic Dependencies
```yaml
jobs:
  - job: JobA
    steps:
      - script: echo "Job A"

  - job: JobB
    dependsOn: JobA  # Wait for JobA to complete
    steps:
      - script: echo "Job B"
```

### Multiple Dependencies
```yaml
jobs:
  - job: JobC
    dependsOn: ['JobA', 'JobB']  # Wait for both jobs
    steps:
      - script: echo "Job C"
```

### Conditional Execution
```yaml
jobs:
  - job: ConditionalJob
    condition: eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')
    steps:
      - script: echo "Only runs on main branch"
```

## Job Strategies

### Matrix Strategy
```yaml
jobs:
  - job: MatrixBuild
    strategy:
      matrix:
        Linux:
          imageName: 'ubuntu-latest'
        Windows:
          imageName: 'windows-latest'
        macOS:
          imageName: 'macOS-latest'
    pool:
      vmImage: $(imageName)
```

### Parallel Execution
```yaml
jobs:
  - job: Job1
    dependsOn: []  # No dependencies - runs immediately
  - job: Job2
    dependsOn: []  # Runs in parallel with Job1
  - job: Job3
    dependsOn: ['Job1', 'Job2']  # Waits for both to complete
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Job Organization
- **Single Responsibility**: Each job should have a clear, single purpose
- **Logical Grouping**: Group related steps within the same job
- **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive display names for jobs

### 2. Dependencies and Parallelization
- **Minimize Dependencies**: Only add dependencies when truly necessary
- **Maximize Parallelism**: Run independent jobs in parallel
- **Critical Path**: Identify and optimize the longest dependency chain

### 3. Resource Management
- **Timeout Configuration**: Set appropriate timeouts for jobs
- **Agent Selection**: Choose the right agent pool for each job
- **Resource Cleanup**: Clean up resources in job steps

### 4. Error Handling
- **Conditional Execution**: Use conditions to control job execution
- **Continue on Error**: Use `continueOnError` when appropriate
- **Retry Logic**: Implement retry for transient failures

### 5. Performance Optimization
- **Artifact Strategy**: Minimize artifact sizes and transfers
- **Caching**: Use caching to speed up repeated operations
- **Job Splitting**: Break large jobs into smaller, parallel jobs

## Common Job Patterns

### Build and Test Pattern
```yaml
jobs:
  - job: Build
    steps:
      - script: dotnet build
      - publish: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)
        artifact: BuildOutput

  - job: Test
    dependsOn: []  # Run in parallel
    steps:
      - script: dotnet test
```

### Fan-out/Fan-in Pattern
```yaml
jobs:
  - job: Prepare
    steps:
      - script: echo "Preparation"

  - job: TestA
    dependsOn: Prepare
    steps:
      - script: echo "Test A"

  - job: TestB
    dependsOn: Prepare
    steps:
      - script: echo "Test B"

  - job: Finalize
    dependsOn: ['TestA', 'TestB']
    steps:
      - script: echo "Finalization"
```

### Environment-Specific Jobs
```yaml
jobs:
  - job: DeployDev
    condition: eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/develop')
    steps:
      - script: echo "Deploy to Dev"

  - job: DeployProd
    condition: eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')
    steps:
      - script: echo "Deploy to Production"
```

Understanding jobs and their configuration options is essential for building efficient, reliable, and maintainable Azure DevOps pipelines.
