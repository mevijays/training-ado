# Azure DevOps Pipeline Triggers

## Overview
Triggers in Azure DevOps Pipelines define the events that automatically start a pipeline execution. They are the gatekeepers that determine when your CI/CD process should run, ensuring your code is built, tested, and deployed at the right moments.

## Explanation
Triggers are event-driven mechanisms that monitor for specific conditions and automatically initiate pipeline runs when those conditions are met. Azure DevOps supports several types of triggers:

1. **CI Triggers (Push Triggers)**: Run when code is pushed to specified branches
2. **PR Triggers (Pull Request Triggers)**: Run when pull requests are created or updated
3. **Scheduled Triggers**: Run at specific times or intervals
4. **Pipeline Triggers**: Run when other pipelines complete
5. **Manual Triggers**: Require manual initiation

## What Are Triggers?

Triggers are essentially "watchers" that continuously monitor your repository and other resources for changes. When a trigger condition is satisfied, it signals the Azure DevOps service to queue and execute your pipeline.

### Key Concepts:
- **Event-driven automation**: No manual intervention required
- **Branch-specific**: Can target specific branches or branch patterns
- **Path-based filtering**: Can trigger based on file path changes
- **Conditional logic**: Support complex conditions for when to trigger

## Analogy
Think of triggers like a security system in your home:

- **Motion sensors** (CI triggers) - detect when someone enters (code is pushed)
- **Door sensors** (PR triggers) - detect when someone tries to enter (pull request created)
- **Timer-based alarms** (scheduled triggers) - activate at specific times (daily backup)
- **Connected alarms** (pipeline triggers) - one alarm triggers another (security system activates lights)
- **Manual switches** (manual triggers) - you control when to activate (testing mode)

Just like you configure your security system to respond to different events, you configure pipeline triggers to respond to different development events.

## Types of Triggers in Detail

### 1. CI Triggers (Continuous Integration)
Automatically run when code is pushed to specified branches.

### 2. PR Triggers (Pull Request)
Run when pull requests are created, updated, or merged.

### 3. Scheduled Triggers
Execute pipelines at predetermined times using cron expressions.

### 4. Pipeline Resource Triggers
Trigger when dependent pipelines complete successfully.

### 5. Manual Triggers
Require human intervention to start the pipeline.

## Advanced Trigger Patterns

### Path-based Triggers
```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include: ['main']
  paths:
    include: ['src/api/*']  # Only trigger for API changes
    exclude: ['docs/*']     # Ignore documentation changes
```

### Tag-based Triggers
```yaml
trigger:
  tags:
    include: ['v*']  # Trigger on version tags like v1.0.0
```

### Disable Triggers
```yaml
trigger: none  # Disable all CI triggers
pr: none       # Disable all PR triggers
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use branch patterns wisely**: Include only necessary branches to avoid unnecessary builds
2. **Implement path filtering**: Exclude non-code files like documentation to save build minutes
3. **Schedule builds appropriately**: Avoid peak hours for scheduled builds
4. **Use draft PR exclusion**: Prevent builds on incomplete work
5. **Monitor trigger patterns**: Review which triggers fire most frequently
6. **Combine conditions**: Use multiple trigger types for comprehensive coverage
7. **Document trigger logic**: Comment complex trigger configurations

## Common Trigger Scenarios

- **Feature Development**: PR triggers for feature branches
- **Release Management**: CI triggers for release branches with tag triggers
- **Hotfix Deployment**: Immediate triggers for hotfix branches
- **Nightly Builds**: Scheduled triggers for comprehensive testing
- **Integration Testing**: Pipeline triggers after successful builds

Understanding and properly configuring triggers is essential for an efficient CI/CD workflow that responds appropriately to development activities.
