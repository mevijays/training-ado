# Release Types: A Simple Guide 🚀

Imagine you're running a lemonade stand and want to make changes without losing customers. Different release types are like different ways to update your lemonade stand!

## 1. Rolling Update 🎪
**What it is:** Like replacing carnival rides one by one while the carnival stays open.

**How it works:** 
- You have 5 lemonade stands
- Replace stand #1 with new recipe
- If customers like it, replace stand #2
- Continue until all stands have the new recipe
- If something goes wrong, you still have other stands running

**Good for:** Small, safe changes that you're confident about

## 2. Blue-Green Deployment 🔵🟢
**What it is:** Like having two identical lemonade stands - one blue, one green.

**How it works:**
- Blue stand serves customers (current version)
- Set up green stand with new recipe (new version)
- Test green stand thoroughly
- When ready, switch all customers to green stand
- Keep blue stand as backup

**Good for:** Big changes where you want instant rollback capability

## 3. Canary Release 🐦
**What it is:** Like sending a canary bird into a mine to test if it's safe.

**How it works:**
- Send 5% of customers to try new lemonade recipe
- Watch if they get sick or love it
- If good, gradually send more customers (10%, 25%, 50%)
- If bad, quickly switch them back to old recipe

**Good for:** Testing risky changes with real customers safely

## 4. Dark Launch 🌙
**What it is:** Like preparing a secret menu that customers can't see yet.

**How it works:**
- New lemonade recipe runs alongside old one
- Customers still get old recipe
- You collect data on how new recipe performs
- When confident, make it visible to customers

**Good for:** Testing performance and infrastructure without affecting users

---

## 5. A/B Testing ⚖️
**What it is:** Like asking "Do you prefer strawberry or orange lemonade?"

**How it works:**
- Group A gets strawberry lemonade (version A)
- Group B gets orange lemonade (version B)
- Measure which group buys more
- Choose the winner for everyone

**Good for:** Comparing two different approaches to see which works better

## 6. Progressive Delivery 📈
**What it is:** Like gradually opening more lemonade stands across the city.

**How it works:**
- Start with one neighborhood (feature flags control who sees what)
- Monitor customer happiness and sales
- Slowly expand to more neighborhoods
- Can instantly turn off if problems occur

**Good for:** Controlled rollout with fine-tuned control over who gets what
